# ADA Guidelines Chapter 13: Adjunctive Therapies
*Analysis Date: 2024-02-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Additional medications used alongside insulin

**Key Topics:** Impact of other medications on glucose management

**Relevance to Project:** Moderate - Important for data interpretation and safety

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Medication Effects on Glucose
**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Use of SGLT inhibitors (increased DKA risk)
  - Use of GLP-1 RA (affects insulin sensitivity)
  - Use of Metformin (affects insulin sensitivity)
  - Other relevant medications

**Impact Considerations:**
- Modified risk thresholds for DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors
- Adjusted insulin sensitivity calculations
- Modified pattern analysis requirements

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. SGLT2 Inhibitor Use
   - Clinical requirement: Modified DKA risk assessment
   - Technical implementation: Adjusted alert thresholds
   - Additional monitoring requirements

## Technical Requirements Summary
### Data Collection
- Required data points:
  - Adjunctive medication usage
  - Medication timing
  - Dose changes

### Processing Requirements
- Modified algorithm parameters based on medication use
- Adjusted safety thresholds
- Pattern analysis adaptation

## Implementation Considerations
### Development Priorities
1. High Priority
   - Feature: Medication status tracking
   - Rationale: Safety and accuracy
   - Technical complexity: Low

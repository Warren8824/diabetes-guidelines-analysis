# ADA Guidelines Chapter 6: Monitoring of Glucose Levels
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Glucose monitoring methods, targets, and metrics

**Key Topics:** CGM, HbA1c, Time in Range, AGP analysis

**Relevance to Project:** Critical - Core functionality for MDI optimization

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. CGM Metrics and Targets
**Guideline Text:**
> GMI is calculated based on the average sensor glucose over the last 14 days... TIR is often taken as 3.9–10 mmol/L (70–180 mg/dL) for most adults and time below range (TBR) as below 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Target values:
  - TIR: >70%
  - TBR: <4% (<3.9 mmol/L), <1% (<3.0 mmol/L)
  - TAR: <25% (>10.0 mmol/L), <5% (>13.9 mmol/L)
  - CV: ≤36%

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - CGM readings (5-minute intervals)
  - Calibration values
  - Gaps in data
  - Time stamps
- Calculations required:
  - GMI calculation
  - TIR/TBR/TAR percentages
  - Coefficient of variation
  - AGP generation

### 2. Data Analysis Requirements
**Clinical Requirements:**
- 14-day minimum analysis period
- 70% minimum data capture
- AGP report generation
- Pattern identification

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Rolling analysis windows
- Data completeness validation

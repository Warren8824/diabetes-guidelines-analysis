# ADA Guidelines Chapter 8: Hypoglycemia
*Analysis Date: 2024-02-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Hypoglycemia prevention, detection, and management
**Key Topics:** Hypoglycemia classification, risk factors, impaired awareness
**Relevance to Project:** Critical - Essential safety component for MDI optimization

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Hypoglycemia Classification
**Guideline Text:**
> Level 1: <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and â‰¥3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)
> Level 2: <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)
> Level 3: Altered mental state/physical state requiring assistance

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - CGM readings
  - Hypo event logs
  - Treatment responses
  - Recovery patterns
- Calculations required:
  - Hypo frequency analysis
  - Pattern prediction
  - Risk assessment

### 2. Risk Assessment
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Risk factors tracking:
  - Previous Level 3 hypos
  - Impaired awareness status
  - Exercise patterns
  - Alcohol consumption
  - Duration of diabetes
  - Kidney disease

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Risk scoring system
- Pattern recognition
- Predictive alerts
- Safety threshold adjustments

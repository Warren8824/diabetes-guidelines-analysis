# ADA Guidelines Chapter 2: Diagnosis
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Diagnostic criteria and classification of T1D

**Key Topics:** Diagnostic processes, autoantibody testing, C-peptide measurement

**Relevance to Project:** Moderate - Important for user classification and safety validation

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Initial Diagnosis Criteria
**Guideline Text:**
> Make an initial diagnosis of type 1 diabetes on clinical grounds in adults presenting with hyperglycemia... age of onset under 50 years body mass index (BMI) below 25 kg/m2 personal and/or family history of autoimmune disease.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Age at diagnosis
  - Initial presentation info
  - Autoantibody status (if available)
  - C-peptide levels (if available)
  - Current therapy validation

**Safety checks:**
- Validation of T1D diagnosis before system use
- Flags for atypical presentations
- Alerts for possible misdiagnosis patterns

### 2. Diagnostic Verification
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Verification of autoantibody status
- C-peptide levels when available
- Treatment response history

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data storage for diagnostic markers
- Validation system for user eligibility
- Safety flags for unusual patterns

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. User Verification
   - Clinical requirement: Confirm T1D diagnosis
   - Technical implementation: Diagnostic criteria checklist
   - Validation needs: Treatment history verification
   - Alert thresholds: Flag atypical presentations

## Technical Requirements Summary
### Data Collection
- Required data points:
  - Diagnosis date
  - Initial presentation details
  - Current treatment regimen
  - Diagnostic test results if available

### Processing Requirements
- Validation of user diagnostic criteria
- System access controls based on diagnostic verification
- Safety checks for appropriate system use

## Implementation Considerations
### User Interface Requirements
- Initial setup questionnaire for diagnostic validation
- Clear warning system for potentially inappropriate use
- Documentation requirements for diagnostic confirmation

## Next Steps
1. Develop diagnostic validation system
2. Create user onboarding process
3. Implement safety checks for appropriate system use

# ADA Guidelines Chapter 11: Diabetic Ketoacidosis
*Analysis Date: 2024-02-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** DKA prevention, detection, and risk management

**Key Topics:** DKA risk factors, prevention strategies, ketone monitoring

**Relevance to Project:** High - Critical safety component for MDI optimization

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. DKA Risk Assessment
**Guideline Text:**
> Risk factors include nonmodifiable factors such as low socioeconomic status, younger age, female sex, and ethnicity, whereas other factors associated with increased risk of DKA are potentially modifiable.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Glucose trends
  - Insulin delivery confirmation
  - Ketone measurements
  - Illness/stress markers
  - Previous DKA history

### 2. Prevention Monitoring
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring needs:
  - Persistent hyperglycemia
  - Missed insulin doses
  - Ketone levels
  - Illness status
  - Stress factors

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Risk factor tracking
- Early warning system
- Emergency protocol triggers

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. DKA Risk Detection
   - Clinical requirement: Early identification of risk patterns
   - Technical implementation: Multi-factor risk analysis
   - Validation needs: Pattern confirmation
   - Alert thresholds: Progressive warning levels

2. Emergency Protocols
   - Clinical requirement: Clear action guidelines

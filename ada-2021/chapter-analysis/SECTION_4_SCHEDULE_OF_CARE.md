# ADA Guidelines Chapter 4: Schedule of Care
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Care delivery timing and assessment requirements

**Key Topics:** Visit frequency, assessment components, telemedicine considerations

**Relevance to Project:** Moderate - Important for data collection scheduling and review periods

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Assessment Frequency
**Guideline Text:**
> A personalized approach for visit frequency is recommended, but visits should occur at least annually. More frequent contact, however, is preferred for most individuals.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Last assessment date
  - Assessment results
  - Changes in therapy
  - Device data review periods

**Calculation Requirements:**
- Time since last assessment
- Alert scheduling for reviews
- Pattern analysis periods

### 2. Data Review Components
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring frequency:
  - CGM data: Daily/Weekly reviews
  - HbA1c: Every 3-12 months
  - Treatment adjustments: As needed based on patterns

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Regular data analysis periods
- Automated pattern detection
- Review scheduling system
- Data export capabilities for healthcare provider review

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Data Collection Frequency
   - Clinical requirement: Minimum data points needed for valid analysis
   - Technical implementation: Data completeness checks
   - Validation needs: Quality of data verification
   - Alert thresholds: Insufficient data warnings

## Technical Requirements Summary
### Data Collection
- Required data points:
  - Daily CGM data

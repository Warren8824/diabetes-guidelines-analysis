# ADA Guidelines Chapter 7: Insulin Therapy
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-03*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Insulin regimens, dosing principles, and adjustments

**Key Topics:** MDI management, basal-bolus therapy, adjustment algorithms

**Relevance to Project:** Critical - Core focus for MDI optimization system

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Basal Insulin Management
**Guideline Text:**
> Most people with type 1 diabetes should use regimens that mimic physiology as closely as possible... MDI of subcutaneous basal insulin analogs and mealtime rapid-acting or ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Target distribution:
  - Basal: 40-60% of TDD
  - Bolus: Split remaining TDD
- Monitoring frequency:
  - Fasting glucose patterns
  - Overnight trends
  - Inter-meal periods

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Basal insulin doses and timing
  - Fasting glucose values
  - Overnight CGM patterns
  - Activity patterns
  - Stress/illness factors

### 2. Insulin Dose Adjustments
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Pattern identification:
  - Fasting highs/lows
  - Post-basal patterns
  - Inter-meal trends
- Adjustment criteria:
  - Pattern duration
  - Magnitude of variance
  - Consistency of pattern

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Pattern analysis algorithms
- Dose adjustment calculations
- Safety validation checks
- Risk assessment tools

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Dose Calculations
   - Clinical requirement: Conservative adjustment recommendations
   - Technical implementation: Multi-day pattern validation
   - Validation needs: Risk assessment before changes
   - Alert thresholds: Maximum adjustment limits

2. Pattern Validation

## Glucose Monitoring Insights

### CGM Data Usage
- **Real-world Accuracy:**
  - LibreFreeStyle 2 with xDrip+ offers improved functionality over standard software
  - Calibration primarily needed at sensor start and when physical symptoms don't match readings (Daily when glucose levels are stable is optimal)
  - Physical symptoms remain important validation tool despite CGM data

- **Pattern Recognition Reality:**
  - AGP proves most useful tool for identifying actionable patterns
  - Successfully used to optimize basal routine from 2 to 3 injections daily
  - Reduced total daily basal by 6 units while improving control
  - TAR/TBR metrics useful when significantly out of range

- **Alert Management:**
  - Custom thresholds set lower than guidelines (8.0 mmol/L vs 10.0 mmol/L) based on physical symptoms
  - Differential alert strategy:
    - High glucose: 1-hour snooze after correction
    - Low glucose: 30-minute snooze with escalating alerts
    - Different day/night protocols using watch vibration
  - Prevention focused with predictive alerts for rapid drops

### Data Interpretation
- **Pattern Confidence:**
  - Consistently achieve 55-75% TIR
  - Physical symptoms used to validate CGM data:
    - High: Dry mouth, frequent urination
    - Low: Clamminess, hunger, weakness
  - Real-time data used to confirm symptom-based suspicions

## Pattern Recognition and Response

### Real-World Pattern Management
- **Action Triggers:**
  - Persistent patterns driving change decisions
  - Physical discomfort often initiates pattern investigation
  - AGP visualization crucial for validating concerns
  - Multiple days/weeks observation before ICR adjustments

### Implementation Challenges
- **Basal Optimization:**
  - Original 2-dose pattern showed consistent issues:
    - Late overnight rises
    - Mid-afternoon glucose elevation
  - Solution required immediate transition to 3 doses
  - Strategic timing choices:
    - 5am (dawn phenomenon)
    - 1pm (afternoon coverage)
    - 9pm (overnight stability)
  - Validation through AGP showed improvement within 2 months

### Timing and Response Patterns
- **Insulin Activity:**
  - Real-world onset differs from guidelines:
    - Initial effect: 15 minutes
    - Main effect: 45 mins - 2 hours
    - Total duration: ~4 hours
    - Higher glucose levels extend onset time
  - Pre-bolusing found ineffective contrary to guidelines (glucose rise takes ~30 mins )
  - Stable glucose 30 minutes pre-meal indicates better meal response

### Workflow Adaptations
- **Daily Management:**
  - Consistent daily routine prioritized
  - Morning correction dose (2 units) standard for dawn phenomenon
  - Meal timing adapted to glucose levels:
    - >5.0 mmol/L: Immediate bolus with meal
    - <5.0 mmol/L: 15-30 minute delay in bolus
  - High-fat/protein meals managed with delayed corrections

## Insulin Management Experience

### Basal Management
- **Optimization Process:**
  - Transitioned from traditional 2-dose to 3-dose regimen
  - Implementation strategy:
    - Immediate transition rather than gradual
    - Started with equal doses, then titrated down
    - Total reduction achieved: 6 units daily
    - Better control with lower total insulin
  - Timing optimization:
    - 5am: Helps with dawn phenomenon (2 unit bolus required also)
    - 1pm: Manages afternoon patterns
    - 9pm: Overnight stability

### Correction Factor Reality
- **ISF Variations:**
  - Standard ISF: 2.2 mmol/L
  - Morning resistance: ~ 1.5 mmol/L (5am-9am)
  - Exercise impact:
    - Increased sensitivity for 24+ hours
    - More predictable with routine exercise
    - Changes in routine require closer monitoring
  - Decision support:
    - Uses xDrip+ IOB calculations
    - Experience-based adjustments
    - Conservative approach during uncertainty

### Meal Management
- **Real-World Bolus Strategy:**
  - Pre-bolusing found counterproductive
  - Situational timing:
    - Immediate bolus if >5.0 mmol/L
    - Delayed bolus if <5.0 mmol/L
  - Complex meals:
    - Secondary corrections at 1+ hours
    - Based on response pattern
  - No time-based ICR variations currently used
  - Meal delays managed through delayed bolusing

### Technology Integration
- **xDrip+ Utilization:**
  - IOB tracking crucial for stacking prevention
  - Timer based insulin pen caps useful for basal timing
  - Immediate logging of insulin required for accuracy in data
  - Predictive alerts enhance safety
  - Data export enables pattern analysis
  - Calibration flexibility improves accuracy
  - Custom alert thresholds help match personal needs

## Special Circumstances and Adaptations

    - Skip exercise if >9.0 mmol/L
  - No pre-exercise insulin adjustments used

### Activity-Specific Responses
- **Pattern Recognition:**
  - Strength training: Slight rise (~1 mmol/L)
  - Aerobic: Delayed decrease after ~1 hour
  - Post-exercise:
    - Increased monitoring
    - Early intervention at 4.5 mmol/L
    - 15g carb snack protocol

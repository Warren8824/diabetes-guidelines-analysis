# MDI Technical Implementation Design Document
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-10*

## Introduction
This section outlines the technical implementation strategy for an MDI optimization system based on comprehensive analysis of ADA and NICE guidelines, combined with real-world patient insights. The system aims to systematically optimize insulin therapy through a phased approach, prioritizing basal insulin optimization before progressing to ISF and ICR refinement.

## Core Objectives
1. Basal Optimization
   - Identify and validate fasting periods
   - Analyze overnight glucose patterns
   - Detect dawn phenomenon
   - Calculate optimal basal adjustments
   - Validate adjustments

2. ISF Refinement
   - Track correction dose effectiveness
   - Identify time-based variations
   - Calculate optimal correction factors
   - Validate adjustment recommendations

3. ICR Optimization
   - Analyze meal response patterns
   - Calculate carbohydrate impact
   - Determine optimal ratios
   - Validate mealtime adjustments

## Implementation Philosophy
- Safety-First Approach
  - Conservative adjustment strategy
  - Multiple validation requirements
  - Comprehensive risk assessment
  - Clear safety protocols

- Progressive Development
  - Modular system architecture
  - Phase-based implementation
  - Iterative improvement
  - Continuous validation

*Analysis Date: 2024-11-10*

## Overview
This document outlines critical safety checks required for MDI optimization, prioritized by importance. Core safety checks are essential for initial implementation, while enhanced checks provide additional layers of protection. The structure supports modular development while maintaining absolute priority on user safety. Each check includes validation requirements and fail-safe protocols.

    - No recent illness/stress markers
  - Safety Bounds:
    - Maximum 10-20% change per adjustment
    - Minimum 3-day observation period (avoid over adjusting)
    - Required stable period verification (Establish stability threshold)
    - Pattern confidence thresholds

    - Minimum time between doses (2 hours)
    - Total daily dose limits (Not Essential, possibly alert for drastic changes)
    - Rate of change restrictions (Alert user > 0.1mmol/L/min, escalate at > 0.2mmol/L/min)

## Risk Prevention Checks

### 1. Hypoglycemia Prevention

  - Critical Thresholds:
    - Level 1: <3.9 mmol/L
    - Level 2: <3.0 mmol/L
    - Rate of drop: >0.1/2 mmol/L/min
    - Pattern predictive alerts (Once ISF and ICR are established)
  - Required Actions:
    - Suspend recommendations
    - Alert user
    - Document event
    - Adjust thresholds (if repeated low BG, suggest raising target range)

### 2. Hyperglycemia/DKA Prevention
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - Critical Thresholds:
    - Level 1: >10.0 mmol/L
    - Level 2: >13.9 mmol/L

    - Pattern predictive alerts (Once ISF and ICR are established)
  - Required Actions:
    - Suspend recommendations
    - Alert user
    - Document event
    - Adjust thresholds (If repeated high BG, suggest lowering target range)

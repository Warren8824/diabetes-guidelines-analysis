# Technical Requirements Summary for MDI Optimization System
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-10*

## Project Overview
This comprehensive technical requirements analysis has established the foundation for developing an MDI optimization system that prioritizes safety while systematically improving insulin management through basal, ISF, and ICR refinement. The analysis covers four critical areas: data points, calculations, safety checks, and validation protocols.

## Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Modular Development Approach
- Progressive implementation starting with core functionality:
  1. Basal optimization through fasting/overnight analysis
  2. ISF refinement through correction tracking
  3. ICR optimization through meal response patterns
- Each phase requires validated stability before progression

### 2. Safety-First Design
- Multi-layered safety system:
  - Real-time data validation
  - Pattern confirmation requirements
  - Conservative adjustment limits
  - Multiple safety thresholds
  - Comprehensive risk assessment

### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making
- Essential Data Requirements:
  - Minimum 70% CGM coverage
  - Multiple pattern confirmation
  - Statistical validation
  - Contextual analysis
  - User input verification

### 4. Validation Framework
- Rigorous testing requirements:
  - Multiple confirmation points
  - Pattern repeatability >80%
  - Outcome tracking
  - User safety verification
  - System performance monitoring

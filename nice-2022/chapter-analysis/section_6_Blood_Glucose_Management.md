# NICE Guidelines Chapter 6: Blood Glucose Management
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-04*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Glucose monitoring, targets, and analysis methods

**Key Topics:** CGM metrics, target ranges, pattern analysis

**Relevance to Project:** Critical - Core functionality for MDI optimization

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Glycemic Targets
**Guideline Text:**
> Support adults with type 1 diabetes to aim for a target HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or lower...
> Pre-prandial target of 4.4–7.2 mmol/L (80–130 mg/dL)
> Peak postprandial glucose of <10.0 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL)

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - CGM readings (5-min intervals)
  - Time buckets:
    - Pre-meal periods
    - Post-meal periods
    - Overnight periods
    - Activity periods
  - Target achievement metrics
  - Pattern identification
  - Risk analysis

### 2. CGM Analysis Requirements
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring metrics:
  - TIR: >70% (3.9-10.0 mmol/L)
  - TBR: <4% (<3.9 mmol/L)
  - TBR: <1% (<3.0 mmol/L)
  - TAR: <25% (>10.0 mmol/L)
  - CV: ≤36%
  - Data capture: >70%

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Real-time calculations:
  - Rolling TIR/TBR/TAR
  - Pattern detection
  - Risk prediction
  - Variability analysis
  - Data quality assessment

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Data Validation
   - Clinical requirement: Minimum 70% data capture
   - Technical implementation: Gap detection
   - Quality metrics: Reliability scoring
   - Alert thresholds: Data insufficiency

2. Pattern Recognition
   - Clinical requirement: Valid pattern identification
   - Implementation: Statistical validation
   - Confidence levels: Pattern strength
   - Safety bounds: Recommendation limits

### Risk Assessment
1. Immediate Risks
   - Hypoglycemia prediction
   - Rapid rate of change
   - Pattern deviations
   - Overnight safety

2. Long-term Risks
   - Glycemic variability
   - Time out of range
   - Pattern deterioration
   - Target achievement

# NICE Guidelines Chapter 14: Managing Complications (Relevant Aspects)
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-04*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Impact of complications on insulin management

**Key Topics:** Gastroparesis, neuropathy, kidney disease effects on insulin needs

**Relevance to Project:** Moderate - Important for adjustment algorithms and safety parameters

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Gastroparesis Impact
**Guideline Text:**
> Consider insulin pump therapy for adults with type 1 diabetes who have gastroparesis... gastroparesis needing specific therapy can only be diagnosed in the absence of hyperglycaemia.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Meal absorption patterns
  - Post-meal glucose responses
  - Insulin timing effectiveness
  - Extended bolus needs
  - Variable absorption patterns

### 2. Kidney Disease Impact
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Modified management for:
  - Changed insulin sensitivity
  - Modified target ranges
  - Hypoglycemia risk increase
  - Extended insulin action
  - Modified correction factors

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Algorithm modifications:
  - Reduced correction factors
  - Extended insulin action time
  - Lower target ranges
  - Enhanced hypo prevention
  - Conservative adjustments

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Complication Status
   - Clinical requirement: Regular status updates
   - Technical implementation: Modified algorithms
   - Validation needs: More conservative changes
   - Alert thresholds: Lower safety margins

2. Risk Assessment
   - Clinical requirement: Enhanced monitoring
   - Implementation: Tighter safety bounds
   - Alert thresholds: Earlier warnings
   - Safety margins: Increased

## Technical Requirements Summary

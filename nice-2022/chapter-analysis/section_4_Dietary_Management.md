# NICE Guidelines Chapter 4: Dietary Management
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-04*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Carbohydrate counting and meal impact

**Key Topics:** Carb counting, meal timing, food effects

**Relevance to Project:** High - Critical for bolus calculations and pattern analysis

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Carbohydrate Counting
**Guideline Text:**
> Offer carbohydrate-counting training to adults with type 1 diabetes as part of structured education programmes for self-management.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Carbohydrate amounts
  - Meal timing
  - Meal composition (fat/protein)
  - Post-meal patterns
  - ICR effectiveness

### 2. Meal Impact Analysis
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring needs:
  - Pre-meal glucose
  - Post-meal patterns
  - Extended meal effects
  - ICR accuracy
  - Timing effects

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Meal data collection interface
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- ICR effectiveness analysis
- Extended bolus suggestions
- High-fat/protein meal adjustments

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Meal Data Validation
   - Clinical requirement: Accurate carb counting
   - Technical implementation: Range validation
   - Validation needs: Pattern confirmation
   - Alert thresholds: Unusual values

2. Pattern Analysis
   - Clinical requirement: Meal response patterns
   - Technical implementation: Post-meal tracking
   - Alert thresholds: Out of range responses
   - Safety bounds: Maximum adjustments

## Technical Requirements Summary
### Data Collection
- Required data points:
  - Meal timing
  - Carbohydrate amounts
  - Additional meal components
  - Pre/post meal glucose
  - Insulin doses

### Processing Requirements
- ICR calculation
- Pattern analysis
- High-fat/protein impact
- Timing effects
- Extended bolus needs

## Implementation Considerations
### Development Priorities
1. High Priority
   - Feature: Meal data collection
   - Feature: ICR analysis
   - Safety impact: High
   - Technical complexity: Moderate

2. Medium Priority
   - Feature: Extended meal effects
   - Feature: Fat/protein impact
   - Technical complexity: High

### User Interface Requirements
- Simple meal logging
- Pattern visualization
- ICR effectiveness display
- Adjustment recommendations
- Meal effect tracking

## Next Steps
1. Design meal logging interface
2. Develop ICR analysis system
3. Create pattern recognition
4. Implement safety validation

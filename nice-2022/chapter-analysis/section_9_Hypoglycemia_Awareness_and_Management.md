# NICE Guidelines Chapter 9: Hypoglycemia Awareness and Management
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-04*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Hypoglycemia detection, prevention, and management

**Key Topics:** Impaired awareness, risk assessment, prevention strategies

**Relevance to Project:** Critical - Essential safety component for MDI optimization

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Hypoglycemia Assessment
**Guideline Text:**
> Assess hypoglycaemia awareness in adults with type 1 diabetes at each annual review. Use the Gold score or Clarke score to quantify hypoglycaemia awareness.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Hypo awareness status
  - Gold/Clarke scores
  - Hypo event history
  - Recovery patterns
  - Risk factors
  - TBR analysis

### 2. Pattern Detection and Prevention
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring needs:
  - Frequency of events
  - Time of occurrence
  - Contributing factors
  - Recovery time
  - Response effectiveness
- Risk levels:
  - High risk: <3.0 mmol/L
  - Alert level: <3.9 mmol/L
  - Impaired awareness indicators

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Pattern recognition algorithms:
  - Predictive analysis
  - Risk factor correlation
  - Time-based patterns
  - Contributing factors
  - Recovery tracking

## Safety Protocols

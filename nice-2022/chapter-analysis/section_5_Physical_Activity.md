# NICE Guidelines Chapter 5: Physical Activity
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-04*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Exercise impact on glucose management

**Key Topics:** Activity patterns, insulin adjustments, glucose responses

**Relevance to Project:** High - Critical for pattern analysis and insulin adjustments

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Exercise Pattern Recognition
**Guideline Text:**
> For adults with type 1 diabetes who choose to increase their level of physical activity [...] provide information about self-monitoring their changed insulin and or nutritional needs

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Exercise type
  - Duration
  - Intensity
  - Timing
  - Glucose response patterns
  - Insulin adjustments
  - Recovery patterns

### 2. Activity Impact Analysis
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring needs:
  - Pre-exercise glucose
  - During exercise trends
  - Post-exercise patterns (up to 24h)
  - Insulin sensitivity changes
  - Hypo risk periods

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Activity tracking interface
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Insulin adjustment suggestions
- Risk prediction
- Recovery monitoring

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Exercise Safety Validation
   - Clinical requirement: Safe starting glucose
   - Technical implementation: Pre-exercise checks
   - Alert thresholds: Modified during activity
   - Safety bounds: Activity-specific ranges

2. Pattern Analysis
   - Clinical requirement: Activity impact tracking
   - Implementation: Response pattern analysis
   - Alert thresholds: Risk prediction
   - Recovery monitoring: Extended tracking

## Technical Requirements Summary
### Data Collection
- Required data points:
  - Activity type/intensity
  - Duration/timing
  - Pre/during/post glucose
  - Insulin adjustments
  - Recovery patterns
  - Hypo events

### Processing Requirements
- Pattern recognition
- Risk prediction
- Adjustment recommendations
- Recovery tracking
- Safety validation

# NICE Guidelines Chapter 10: Ketone Monitoring and Managing DKA
*Analysis Date: 2024-11-04*

## Chapter Overview
**Focus Area:** Ketone monitoring and DKA prevention

**Key Topics:** Risk assessment, early detection, prevention strategies

**Relevance to Project:** High - Critical safety component for insulin adjustment decisions

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Ketone Monitoring
**Guideline Text:**
> Consider ketone monitoring (blood or urine) as part of 'sick-day rules' for adults with type 1 diabetes, to help with self-management of hyperglycaemia.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - Ketone readings (if available)
  - Persistent hyperglycemia patterns
  - Insulin delivery confirmation
  - Illness markers
  - Risk factors

### 2. DKA Risk Assessment
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Monitoring needs:
  - Glucose >13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)
  - Missed insulin doses
  - Illness status
  - Pump failures (if relevant)
  - Historical DKA events

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Risk analysis algorithms:
  - Pattern detection
  - Missing insulin detection
  - Risk factor correlation
  - Early warning system
  - Emergency protocols

## Safety Protocols
### Critical Safety Points
1. Early Warning System
   - Clinical requirement: Early risk detection
   - Technical implementation: Multi-factor analysis
   - Alert thresholds: Progressive warnings
   - Emergency protocols: Clear guidance

2. Risk Pattern Detection
   - Clinical requirement: Pattern identification
   - Implementation: Continuous monitoring
   - Validation needs: Multiple risk factors
   - Alert levels: Tiered response system

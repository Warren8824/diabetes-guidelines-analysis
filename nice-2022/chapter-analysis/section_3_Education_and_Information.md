**Relevance to Project:** High - Critical for system usage and safety

## Clinical Recommendations
### 1. Structured Education
**Guideline Text:**
> Offer all adults with type 1 diabetes a structured education programme of proven benefit, for example the DAFNE programme [...] within 6 to 12 months after diagnosis.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Data points needed:
  - User knowledge level
  - Training completion status
  - Competency assessments
  - Feature access levels
  - Education progress

### 2. Progressive Learning System
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Education levels:
  - Level 1: Basic information
  - Level 2: Ongoing learning
  - Level 3: Advanced features
- Knowledge validation
- Progress tracking

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Progressive feature unlocking
- Knowledge assessment system
- Competency tracking
- Safety validation
- Resource access management

## Safety Protocols

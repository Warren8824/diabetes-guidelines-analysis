# Clinical Guidelines Analysis for T1D Management System
### A Patient-Developer's Implementation Analysis of NICE & ADA Guidelines

## Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of the NICE (2022) and ADA (2021) Type 1 Diabetes management guidelines from both patient and developer perspectives. The analysis serves as a foundation for building evidence-based diabetes management tools while incorporating real-world implementation insights.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze clinical guidelines through both patient and developer lenses
- Document real-world implementation challenges and opportunities
- Create technical specifications for evidence-based diabetes management tools
- Bridge the gap between clinical recommendations and practical application
